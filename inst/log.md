## Image classification of cats and dogs
This application is very interesting because we work directly with the images and not the arrays and is commonly done. The images are in `jpg` format.

### Dataset
* This example
![](img\8802d28ea307a907427607b2115d8320.png)
requires all the images of cats and dogs; approximately `595 MB`.
* Saves the images to `.rds` files.
