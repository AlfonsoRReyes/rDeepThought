```{r}
library(reticulate)
np <- import("numpy", convert = FALSE)
# np$arange(1,25)$reshape(4L, 3L, 2L)
(x.py.cm <- np$reshape(np$arange(1, 25), c(4L, 3L, 2L), "F"))
```

> This is how column-major looks in R printing.

```{r}
(y.py.cm <- py_to_r(x.py.cm))
```

> Let's generate the same array in R, which is going to be, by default, column-major.

```{r}
(z.r.cm <- array(1:25, dim = c(4, 3, 2)))
```

> Now, if both arrays are the same, the difference must be zero:

```{r}
y.py.cm - z.r.cm
```
