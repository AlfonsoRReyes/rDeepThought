The Keras R interface uses the TensorFlow backend engine by default.

We can learn the basics of Keras by walking through a simple example: recognizing handwritten digets from the MNIST dataset. MNIST consists of 28 x 28 grayscale images of handwritten digits like these:


```{r, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://keras.rstudio.com/images/MNIST.png")
```


## Preparing the Data
The MNIST dataset is included with Keras and can be accessed using the dataset_mnist() function. Here we load the dataset then create variables for our test and training data:


```{r}
library(keras)

mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y
```


The x data is a 3-d array (images,width,height) of grayscale values:

```{r}
dim(x_train)
dim(x_test)
```


To prepare the data for training we convert the 3-d arrays into matrices by reshaping width and height into a single dimension (28x28 images are flattened into length 784 vectors). 

```{r}
# reshape
dim(x_train) <- c(nrow(x_train), 784)
dim(x_test)  <- c(nrow(x_test), 784)

dim(x_train)
dim(x_test)
```

Convert the grayscale values from integers ranging between 0 to 255 into floating point values ranging between 0 and 1:

```{r}
# rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test  <- x_test / 255
```


The y data is an integer vector with values ranging from 0 to 9. 

```{r}
dim(y_train)
dim(y_test)

head(y_train)
summary(y_train)
range(y_train)
range(y_test)
```

To prepare this data for training we one-hot encode the vectors into binary class matrices using the Keras `to_categorical()` function:

```{r}
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test  <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)

names(y_train)
range(y_train)
```

```{r}
colnames(y_train)
rownames(y_train)
```

## Defining the Model
The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers.

We begin by creating a sequential model and then adding layers using the pipe (%>%) operator:

```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential() 

model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')
```

The input_shape argument to the first layer specifies the shape of the input data (a length 784 numeric vector representing a grayscale image). The final layer outputs a length 10 numeric vector (probabilities for each digit) using a `softmax` activation function.

```{r}
summary(model)
```


Next, compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics:

```{r}
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```

## Training and Evaluation
Use the fit() function to train the model for 30 epochs using batches of 128 images:
```{r}
history <- model %>% 
    fit(x_train, y_train, 
        epochs = 30, 
        batch_size = 128, 
        validation_split = 0.2
)
```

The history object returned by fit() includes loss and accuracy metrics which we can plot:

```{r}
plot(history)
```

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test data:

```{r}
loss_and_metrics <- model %>% 
    evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

```{r}
loss_and_metrics
```


Generate predictions on new data:

```{r}
classes <- model %>% 
    predict_classes(x_test)
```


```{r}
classes
```


Keras provides a vocabulary for building deep learning models that is simple, elegant, and intuitive. Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a neural Turing machine, or any other model is just as straightforward.
