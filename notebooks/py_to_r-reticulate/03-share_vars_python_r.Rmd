Pandas is installed by default in the `base` environment.
For other environments, `pandas` has to be installed manually.

## Read file using Python

```{python}
import pandas

flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[flights["DESTINATION_AIRPORT"] == "ORD"]
flights = flights[["AIRLINE", "DEPARTURE_DELAY", "ARRIVAL_DELAY"]]
flights = flights.dropna()
print(flights.head())
```

## Plot data with R

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(py$flights, aes(AIRLINE, ARRIVAL_DELAY)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_jitter()
```
